                <h1>Egypt</h1>
                <p>Egypt is a country in northeastern Africa, known for its rich history and ancient civilization, including the pyramids and the Sphinx. The Nile River, the longest river in the world, runs through Egypt and supports much of its agriculture. Today, Egypt is a cultural and political leader in the Arab world, with Cairo as its capital.
                    Modern Egypt plays a vital role in Middle Eastern politics and is a founding member of the Arab League and the African Union. Its economy is diverse, including sectors like tourism, agriculture, natural gas, and the strategically crucial Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.

                        The Mosque of Muhammad Ali is located inside the Citadel of Salah al-Din al-Ayyubi (Saladin) in Cairo. It was built by Muhammad Ali Pasha in 1265 AH\ 1848 AD on the site of Mamluk palaces. This mosque is known as the "Alabaster Mosque", in reference to its marble paneling on its interior and exterior walls.
                         The mosque’s twin minarets are the highest in all of Egypt, each reaching a height of 84 meters.
                         The mosque was built on the Turkish style that consists of an open court and prayer hall. The prayer hall is a square space that surmounted with a large central dome which surrounded by four semi-domes and four shallow domes in the corners. 
                         There are two minbars (pulpits) inside the mosque. The original of the two is made of wood decorated in green. The other was a later addition made of marble.  
                         Limestone is the mosque’s main building material. Its square plan consists of a central dome supported by four half.

                     <p> 
                        Al-Azhar Mosque, known in Egypt simply as al-Azhar, is a mosque in Cairo, Egypt in the historic Islamic core of the city. Commissioned as the new capital of the Fatimid Caliphate in 970, it was the first mosque established in a city that eventually earned the nickname "the City of a Thousand Minarets".

                        Over the centuries, Al-Azhar Mosque evolved into a center of Islamic learning, eventually leading to the establishment of Al-Azhar University, one of the world's oldest continuously operating universities. The mosque has undergone numerous expansions and renovations under different rulers, including the Mamluks and Ottomans, who contributed to its architectural grandeur.

                            The Sultan Hassan Mosque, located in Cairo, Egypt, is one of the most magnificent examples of Mamluk architecture and Islamic art. Commissioned by Sultan an-Nasir Hassan in 1356 and completed in 1363, the mosque also served as a madrasa, teaching the four Sunni schools of Islamic jurisprudence. It is renowned for its grand scale, with a monumental entrance portal,
                             towering minarets, and a vast open courtyard surrounded by four iwans. The interior features intricate marble inlays, carved stucco, and a beautifully adorned mihrab.  
                             Although Sultan Hassan was assassinated before the mosque's completion and was never buried in the mausoleum intended for him, the structure remains a lasting symbol of Mamluk power and religious devotion. Positioned near the Cairo Citadel, the mosque continues to function as a place of worship and stands as a major historical and architectural landmark in the Islamic world.

                                The Three Pyramids of Giza, located just outside Cairo, Egypt, are among the most iconic and important monuments of ancient Egypt. Built during the Fourth Dynasty around 2600–2500 BCE, these pyramids served as tombs for three powerful pharaohs. The largest is the Great Pyramid, constructed for Pharaoh Khufu (also known as Cheops), which originally stood 
                                at 146.6 meters and held the record as the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years. The second pyramid was built for Khufu’s son, Pharaoh Khafre (Chephren), and 
                                although slightly smaller, it appears taller due to being built on higher ground. Near Khafre’s pyramid stands the Great Sphinx, a massive limestone statue believed to bear his likeness. 
                                he third and smallest pyramid belongs to Pharaoh Menkaure, known for its fine craftsmanship and partial granite casing. These pyramids were constructed with remarkable precision, showcasing the ancient Egyptians’ advanced knowledge of engineering, astronomy, and mathematics.

                                The Luxor Temple is a magnificent ancient Egyptian temple located on the east bank of the Nile River in the city of Luxor, formerly known as Thebes. Constructed around 1390–1352 BCE during the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep III, and later expanded by rulers such as Tutankhamun, Horemheb, and Ramses II, the temple was primarily dedicated to the Theban Triad of Amun, 
                                Mut, and Khonsu. Unlike many temples in Egypt that served as mortuary or cult centers, Luxor Temple played a key role in the Opet Festival, an annual celebration that marked the Nile's flooding and reaffirmed the pharaoh’s divine rule. During this festival, statues of the gods were transported from Karnak Temple to Luxor Temple along the Avenue of Sphinxes, a ceremonial road lined with hundreds of sphinx statues. Architecturally, the temple is renowned for its grand colonnades, massive pylons, and statues of Ramses II. Over the centuries, it was repurposed by the Romans, who built a fortress and church within its walls, and later by Muslims, who
                                 constructed the Abu Haggag Mosque inside the complex—a structure still in use today.
