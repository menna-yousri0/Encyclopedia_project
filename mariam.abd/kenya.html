               <h2>Maasai Mara National reserve</h2>
                <p>
                    Maasai Mara is one of the wildlife conservation and wilderness areas in Africa, with its populations of lions, leopards, cheetahs and African bush elephants. It also hosts the Great Migration, which secured it as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of Africa, and as one of the ten Wonders of the World.
                    Masai Mara National Reserve measures 1,510 square kilometers, which is about 583 square miles.
                    The reserve serves as an important habitat for many different animal species and provides the perfect environment for game viewing. It's also home to many different cultures and communities that live in harmony with nature.
                    Pleasant temperatures, warm and dry weather, and mostly clear blue skies above. Perfect weather for wildlife safaris and therefore a popular time for safari travel to the Masai Mara. 
                    The Masai Mara is expensive due to a combination of high park entry fees, costly accommodation, and essential conservation-related expenses. Recent fee increases doubled non-resident rates to USD 200 in peak season, with ticket validity reduced from 24 to 12 hours, effectively doubling daily costs.

               <h2>Mount Kenya</h2>
                    <p>
                         Mount Kenya National Park, established in 1949, protects the region surrounding the mountain. Currently, the national park is within the forest reserve which encircles it. In April 1978 the area was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. The national park and the forest reserve, combined, became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.
                         The Government of Kenya had four reasons for creating a national park on and around Mount Kenya. These were the importance of tourism for the local and national economies, preserving an area of great scenic beauty, conserving the biodiversity within the park, and preserving the water catchment for the surrounding area.
                         Its diameter at the base averages 120 km. It was formed between 2.6 and 3.1 million years ago by eruptions of successive layers of lava and agglomerates from a central vent in the earth's surface.
                         Mount Kenya is an extinct volcano which originally rose an estimated 3 million years ago and last erupted an estimated 2.6 million years ago. Mount Kenya National Park was formed in 1949 and in 1978 the site became a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve before finally being named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.

               <h2>Lake Nakuru</h2>  
               <p> 
                    Lake Nakuru is one of the Rift Valley lakes, located at an elevation of 1,754 m above sea level. It lies to the south of Nakuru, in the rift valley of Kenya and is protected by Lake Nakuru National Park. The lake's abundance of algae used to attract a vast quantity of flamingos that famously lined the shore. 
                    It is one of the saline lakes of the lake system lying in the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. Primarily known for its many species of birds, including vast numbers of pink flamingos, Lake Nakuru also has waterbucks, impalas, and hippopotamuses. The town of Nakuru lies on its north shore.
                    About 10,000 years ago, Nakuru and its two neighbor lakes, Elmenteita and Naivasha (60 km south of Nakuru), formed a single deep freshwater lake, which however dried owing to the later desiccation of climate leaving the three separate lakes as remnants.
                    The flamingos are the most famous attraction of Lake Nakuru National park and it's one thing tourists are excited to see on their visit to the park; it is estimated that at a given time lake Nakuru can host over a million flamingos meaning you can never miss to see them on your visit.
