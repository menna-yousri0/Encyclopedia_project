            <h1>Morocco</h1>
            <p>Morocco has a rich history influenced by Berber, Arab, and European cultures, with Islam introduced in the 7th century and a legacy of powerful Islamic dynasties. It gained independence from France in 1956 and is now a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Mohammed VI. The economy is diverse, with strong sectors in agriculture, tourism, mining, and manufacturing, and it is the world’s largest exporter of phosphates.</p>

                    <h2>Al-Bahaya palace</h2>
                    <p> 
                        The Bahia palace is divided into different rooms such as the Hall for businesses and administrative purposes; the 4 rooms for his wives which are equal in size, meaning all 4 wives are equal in status; 
                        the quarter for his 24 concubines, with 12 rooms to share (2 concubines in 1 room) and a dining room; the School, where Abu’s sons and daughters are taught by their teachers and turned into
                         a mosque 5 times a day for praying; and Abu’s own quarters, where there is his summer room with windows and a smaller one for winter without any windows, as well as his very own private dining room.  
                         The oldest part of the Bahia palace complex, completed in 1867 by Si Moussa, a former slave who rose through the ranks to become one of Sultan Hassan I’s most important aides. The riad’s salon is bedecked with carved wood lintels, zouak
                     artistry and stained-glass detailing – Bahia Palace was thought to be the first building in North Africa to use stained glass as a decorative feature 
                     Today, Bahia Palace is a major tourist attraction and a venue for cultural events, music concerts, and art exhibitions.

                        The Jemaa el-Fna Square is one of the main cultural spaces in Marrakesh and has become one of the symbols of the city since its foundation in
                         the eleventh century. It represents a unique concentration of popular Moroccan cultural traditions performed through musical, religious and artistic expressions.   
                         Jemaa el-Fna is the city's top attraction and can be visited at all hours of the day. We even recommend visiting in the morning and then 
                         returning at night to see how it has metamorphosed. Watching its various shows are also great fun! Marrakech's main square is definitely never dull.
                         The square continued to serve as a meeting place at the heart of the city despite having no formal architectural delineation.
                         Recognizing its cultural significance, UNESCO designated Jemaa el-Fnaa as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001, highlighting its role in preserving traditional Moroccan arts and practices. Today, it remains a symbol of Marrakesh's rich heritage and a must-visit destination for those seeking an authentic Moroccan experience. </p>

                    <h2 > Atlas mountain </h2>
                    <p> 
                        The Atlas Mountains are a mountain range in the Maghreb in North Africa. They separate the Sahara Desert from the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean; the name "Atlantic" is derived from the mountain range, which stretches around 2,500 km (1,600 mi) through Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. The range's highest peak is Toubkal, which is in central Morocco, with an elevation of 4,167 metres (13,671 ft). The Atlas Mountains are primarily inhabited by Berber populations.
                        The terms for 'mountain' are Adrar and adras in some Berber languages, and these terms are believed to be cognates of the toponym Atlas. The mountains are home to a number of animals and plants which are mostly found within Africa but some of which can be found in Europe. Many of these species are endangered and a few are already extinct. The weather is generally cool but summers are sunny, and the average temperature there is 25 °C. The Atlas Mountains have earned a reputation as a trekkers’ den, attracting adventurers year-round.  
                        The Atlas are rich in natural resources. </p>
