              <h2>Sidi Bou Said
            </h2>
              <p>  

This blue-and-white wonderland looks like it was painted by the gods of aesthetics.
Perched on a cliff overlooking the Mediterranean, it's basically a postcard you can walk through.
Every door is a piece of art, every alley a perfect Instagram angle.
Cafés like Café des Délices serve mint tea with million-dollar views.
It’s a magnet for artists, lovers, and poets — even Paul Klee couldn’t resist its charm!
You can get lost in its beauty, and honestly, you should.
The vibes? Peaceful, breezy, and always photogenic.
Don’t forget to grab a bambalouni (Tunisian donut) from a street vendor.
This is Tunisia’s Santorini — but with more soul and better tea.
Visiting Sidi Bou Said is like stepping into a dream you don’t want to wake up from.

              <h2>Zitouna Mosque</h2>
              <p>  
                founded in 732 AD, Al-Zaytuna Mosque is one of the oldest in North Africa.
                Its name means "Mosque of the Olive," and it’s been spreading knowledge for over a millennium.
                This mosque was once a major center of learning — like Harvard, but with more mosaics.
                The architecture blends Arab, Andalusian, and Ottoman influences — a true cultural cocktail.
                Its minaret stands tall in the heart of Tunis’s medina, calling out wisdom five times a day.
                Scholars from all over came here to study theology, science, and philosophy.
                Even the courtyards feel like they’re thinking deep thoughts.
                Step inside, and you’re walking through centuries of knowledge and prayer.
                It’s not just a mosque — it’s a living library of spiritual history.
                Zitouna is where faith meets intellect and elegance meets devotion.

              <h2>Carthage</h2>
              <p>  
Carthage was once the jewel of the Mediterranean, founded by the Phoenicians around 814 BC.
It became a powerful empire, rivaling Rome itself until their dramatic clash in the Punic Wars.
Today, its ruins sit quietly near Tunis, whispering stories of Queen Dido and General Hannibal.
You can wander among Roman baths, ancient ports, and stone-carved memories.
The Antonine Baths are massive — Romans really knew how to relax!
Climb Byrsa Hill for stunning views and a taste of history layered in time.
Carthage is a UNESCO site — because of course it is, it's iconic!
There’s something poetic about how a once-mighty empire now offers peace and perspective.
A perfect stop for history buffs, romantic dreamers, and curious wanderers.
Come for the ruins, stay for the vibe... and maybe a Carthaginian selfie or two!
