              <p class="description">The Eiffel Tower is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world and a symbol of Paris, France. It was designed by engineer Gustave Eiffel and constructed between 1887 and 1889 for the Exposition Universelle, held to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. At the time of its completion, the tower was the tallest man-made structure in the world, standing at 330 meters (1,083 feet) tall. Built using over 18,000 iron parts and 2.5 million rivets, the Eiffel Tower demonstrated groundbreaking engineering for its time.
                    Although it faced criticism from some artists and intellectuals when first built—who saw it as an eyesore—it gradually became one of the most beloved structures in France. The tower has three levels open to the public. The first two levels house restaurants, while the third level, accessible by elevator, offers panoramic views of the Paris skyline.  
                  The Eiffel Tower is also a cultural icon, appearing in countless films, artworks, and literature. It attracts around 7 million visitors annually, making it one of the most visited monuments in the world."The Eiffel Tower is a famous tourist attraction and a must-see landmark in Paris.</p>

               <h2 class="name">Arc de Triomphe</h2>
               <p class="description">The Arc de Triomphe is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, France. It stands at the western end of the Champs-Élysées, at the center of Place Charles de Gaulle, where twelve major avenues meet. Commissioned by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1806 after his victory at Austerlitz, the arch was built to honor the French army and its soldiers. The construction took several decades and was completed in 1836 during the reign of King Louis-Philippe.

               Standing 50 meters tall and 45 meters wide, the Arc de Triomphe is decorated with intricate carvings and sculptures that depict scenes from various French military campaigns. On its inner and outer surfaces are engraved the names of hundreds of generals and battles. Beneath the arch lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, added after World War I in 1921, with an eternal flame that burns in memory of unidentified soldiers who died in battle.
            
               The Arc de Triomphe is not only a powerful symbol of national pride and military glory, but also a popular tourist attraction. Visitors can climb to the top for a panoramic view of Paris.</p>

           <h2 class="name">Palace of Versailles</h2>
           <p class="description">The Palace of Versailles, located just outside Paris, France, is one of the most famous and grandest palaces in the world. Originally a hunting lodge built by King Louis XIII in 1623, it was transformed and expanded by his son, King Louis XIV, into a magnificent royal residence. By the late 17th century, Versailles had become the center of political power in France, symbolizing the absolute monarchy and the wealth of the French crown.

            The palace is renowned for its opulent architecture, stunning gardens, and extravagant interiors. One of its most famous features is the Hall of Mirrors (Galerie des Glaces), a long gallery with 357 mirrors that reflect the light from the grand windows facing the gardens. The palace includes hundreds of rooms, lavishly decorated with gold, fine art, and luxurious furnishings.
            
            Versailles also played a key role in history. It was the site of many significant events, including the signing of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, which ended World War I. Today, the Palace of Versailles is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a major tourist attraction, drawing millions of visitors each year who come to witness the grandeur of French royal life and architecture.</p>
