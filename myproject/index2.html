        <p class="container">Italy is renowned for its historic and artistic monuments that span centuries. The Colosseum in Rome is an ancient amphitheater symbolizing the grandeur of the Roman Empire. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is famous for its unintended tilt and unique architecture. St. Peter’s Basilica in Vatican City is a masterpiece of Renaissance design and a spiritual center for Catholics. The Pantheon, also in Rome, showcases ancient Roman engineering with its massive dome. Florence’s Cathedral, the Duomo, is a Gothic marvel with a striking red-tiled dome by Brunelleschi.</p>

        <h2 class="name">Colosseum</h2>
         <p class="description">The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is one of the most iconic landmarks of ancient Rome and a symbol of Roman engineering and architecture. Located in the heart of Rome, Italy, it was commissioned by Emperor Vespasian in AD 70-72 and completed by his son, Titus, in AD 80. The Colosseum could hold up to 80,000 spectators and was primarily used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, and other forms of entertainment, such as animal hunts, mock naval battles, and executions. Its elliptical structure, made from concrete and stone, is an architectural marvel, featuring a complex system of arches and vaults. The Colosseum was built with four levels: the lowest for the elite, the next for ordinary citizens, and the upper levels for the poorer classes. The arena was equipped with a retractable roof and trapdoors, allowing for various staging effects. Although much of the Colosseum was damaged by earthquakes and looting over the centuries, it remains a symbol of the grandeur and cruelty of Roman entertainment. Today, the Colosseum is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of the most visited tourist attractions in the world.</p>

            <h2 class="name">Leaning Tower of Pisa</h2>
          <p class="description">The Leaning Tower of Pisa, located in Pisa, Italy, is one of the most recognized and iconic structures in the world. It is actually the freestanding bell tower of the Cathedral of Pisa, part of the city's UNESCO World Heritage site. The tower was built between the 12th and 14th centuries, starting in 1173, with construction halted multiple times due to the unstable soil beneath it. The famous tilt began soon after the construction of the second floor, as the ground underneath the tower couldn't support its weight. Despite attempts to correct the tilt, the tower leaned more over the centuries, reaching an angle of 5.5 degrees before restoration efforts in the late 20th century reduced the tilt to a safer 3.99 degrees. The tower stands about 57 meters (186 feet) tall and has 8 stories, including the chamber for the seven bells. Its white and gray marble exterior and Romanesque design make it a stunning example of medieval architecture. The Leaning Tower of Pisa has become a symbol of architectural curiosity and human ingenuity in overcoming engineering challenges. </p>

            <h2 class="name">Trevi Fountain</h2>
         <p class="description">The Trevi Fountain (Fontana di Trevi) is one of the most famous and grandiose fountains in the world, located in the heart of Rome, Italy. Completed in 1762, it was designed by architect Niccolò Salvi and features an elaborate Baroque style. The fountain stands at the junction of three roads, or tre vie, which is the origin of its name. It marks the end of the ancient Aqua Virgo aqueduct, which provided water to ancient Rome. The central figure of the fountain is Neptune, the god of the sea, riding a chariot pulled by two horses, one calm and the other agitated, symbolizing the contrasting moods of the sea. Surrounding Neptune are various sculptures representing the abundance of water, health, and the blessings of the gods. The fountain is renowned for its size and ornate design, measuring about 26 meters (85 feet) in height and 20 meters (66 feet) in width. Tradition holds that if visitors throw a coin into the fountain over their left shoulder, they will ensure their return to Rome. Each year, an estimated €1.5 million in coins are thrown into the Trevi Fountain, which is collected and donated to charity. The Trevi Fountain remains one of Rome's most beloved and visited landmarks.</p>
