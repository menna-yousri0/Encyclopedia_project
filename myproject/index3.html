            <h2 class="name">Alhambra Palace</h2>
          <p class="description">The Alhambra Palace is a stunning example of Islamic architecture, located in Granada, Spain. Originally constructed in the mid-13th century by the Nasrid dynasty, it served as a royal residence and fortress. The name "Alhambra" comes from the Arabic word "Al-Ḥamrāʾ", meaning "the red one," referring to the reddish color of the palace's walls. The palace complex is known for its breathtaking beauty and is a blend of Islamic, Christian, and Jewish architectural influences. It consists of several sections, including the Alcazaba (fortress), the Palacio Real (royal palace), and the Generalife (a summer palace with extensive gardens). One of the most famous areas is the Patio de los Leones (Court of the Lions), where intricately carved columns and a central fountain surrounded by a colonnade create a serene atmosphere. The Hall of the Ambassadors inside the palace features beautiful stucco work and intricate tile mosaics. The Alhambra's gardens, with their water features, fountains, and courtyards, represent the Islamic concept of paradise. Throughout history, the Alhambra has been a symbol of Muslim Spain's cultural and artistic achievements.</p>

            <h2 class="name">Sagrada Familia</h2>
          <p class="description">The Sagrada Familia is an extraordinary basilica located in Barcelona, Spain, and is one of the most famous architectural masterpieces in the world. Designed by the renowned architect Antoni Gaudí, construction began in 1882, and it remains unfinished to this day, with an anticipated completion date around 2026. The Sagrada Familia is known for its unique and innovative design, blending Gothic and Art Nouveau elements in a way that had never been seen before. Gaudí devoted much of his life to the project, and his intricate designs and religious symbolism can be seen in every aspect of the basilica. The church is characterized by its towering spires, with plans for 18 in total, each representing a different religious figure, including Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and the apostles. The Nativity Facade and Passion Facade are two of the most remarkable features of the basilica, showcasing Gaudí’s distinctive style with flowing, organic shapes and detailed sculptures. Inside, the columns resemble trees, creating a forest-like atmosphere, and light filters through colorful stained glass windows, adding to the spiritual ambiance. </p>

            <h2 class="name">Park Güell</h2>
          <p class="description">Park Güell is a public park located in Barcelona, Spain, designed by the famous architect Antoni Gaudí. Originally conceived as part of a housing project, it was transformed into a public park in 1923 after the project failed. The park is one of Gaudí's most celebrated works, showcasing his distinctive modernist style, with vibrant mosaics, undulating forms, and natural elements integrated into the design. It covers around 17.18 hectares (42.4 acres) and is characterized by colorful, organic shapes and intricate details, reflecting Gaudí’s deep connection to nature. The park's centerpiece is the serpentine bench that winds around the Plaza de la Naturaleza, offering stunning views of the city. Another iconic feature is the Dragon Fountain at the entrance, adorned with vibrant ceramic tiles, symbolizing the union of art and nature. Gaudí also designed the Hypostyle Room, which contains 86 columns and was intended as a market area. The park's pathways and gardens, along with the innovative use of natural shapes and materials, make it a popular destination for both locals and tourists.</p>
