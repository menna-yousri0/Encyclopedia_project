                    <p class="description">The Big Ben Tower adorns the Palace of Westminster in London, as it is not
                        just
                        an ordinary watch,
                        but
                        rather an ancient cultural symbol that embodies the ancient history of the United Kingdom, and
                        the
                        name
                        "Big Ben" goes beyond the limits of the clock to include the entire tower, and was named after
                        the
                        huge
                        bell inside, and it is one of the most famous landmarks in the world, and its image appears
                        frequently
                        in movies and television programs as a symbol of Britain.Big Ben’s mighty clock tower is one of
                        the
                        most recognizable landmarks around the globe and one of England’s most iconic symbols. Perched
                        on.
                        the banks of the Thames alongside the Palace of Westminster, it’s impossible to miss while in
                        London. The clock and tower are currently being refurbished but are set to unveil sometime in
                        2022.

                    <h3>the Tower of London</h3>
                    <p class="description">Today the Tower of London is one of England's most popular tourist
                        attractions
                        and was added to the
                        World
                        Heritage Site in 1988. The Tower of London is at the forefront of the allegedly haunted places
                        in
                        England and the entire British Isles, and generations have passed down a few fairy tales that
                        the
                        souls
                        of those executed in the tower still roam, most notably Anne Boleyn, the second wife of King
                        Henry
                        VIII,
                        Countess Margaret Pooley, and Princes Edward and Richard, the sons of King Edward IV, who are
                        said
                        to
                        have disappeared in the tower. The tower was also famous for its crows that nest on its lands,
                        which
                        was
                        associated with an ancient prophecy that on the day the last crows will leave the Tower of
                        London,
                        the
                        throne of England will fall and with it will fall Great Britain, so a number of kings were keen
                        to
                        preserve the crows and their nesting grounds in the tower.Built nearly 1,000 years ago, the
                        Tower of
                        London is one of London’s best and most beloved historical sites. Steeped in legend and one of
                        the
                        oldest sites in London, it’s hard not to fall for the history and stories that surround this
                        iconic
                        English monument. Moreover, it’s home to the iconic Beefeaters who’ve been the ceremonial guards
                        of
                        the tower for centuries.</p>
