                <h3>The Brandenburg Gat</h3>
                <p class="description">The Brandenburg Gate is the famous symbol of German unity. Since its completion
                    in 1791 it has been
                    considered the most dramatic landmark in European history. Today it is the main platform for
                    celebrating
                    the thirtieth anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Brandenburg Gate in modern history is
                    considered the scene of real events of the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.Symbolizing unity and
                    peace,
                    this iconic monument in Berlin played a significant role in Germany’s history. Built in the late
                    18th
                    century and modelled on the Propylaeum of Athens’ Acropolis, it was commissioned by King Frederick
                    William II of Prussia as a grand entrance to the city.

                    Throughout its existence, the gate has witnessed many historic events, including Napoleonic
                    conquests,
                    World War II, and the division of Berlin during the Cold War. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in
                    1989,
                    the Brandenburg Gate became a symbol of German reunification.</p>

                <h3>Neuschwanstein Palace</h3>
                <p class="description">Located in Germany's picturesque Bavarian Alps, Neuschwanstein Palace is a true
                    embodiment of
                    fairytale
                    charm and architectural wonders. Built by the visionary King Ludwig II, this iconic palace carries a
                    rich history and boasts magnificent features that continue to attract visitors from all over the
                    world.You’ll probably have seen Neuschwanstein Castle in photos – but there’s nothing like seeing it
                    up
                    close, as Dani confirms.

                    “As you drive towards the castle, it looks like it’s painted onto the scenery – it’s hard to believe
                    it’s real. The walk up to the castle, along wooded paths, is almost as magical. Then when you arrive
                    at
                    the castle itself, seeing those towering turrets, combined with views across the surrounding
                    landscape,
                    is an unforgettable experience.

                    “We’ll also head inside the castle to see some of the interior rooms, including the Throne Room and
                    the
                    Lohengrin Grotto. But it’s the outside that’s truly astounding.”

                <h3>Cologne Cathedral</h3>
                <p class="description">Cologne Cathedral (German: Kölner Dom Kölner Dom (official name Hohe Domkirche
                    St. Peter und Maria)
                    is
                    one of the most famous architectural and religious monuments in Germany and has a high ability to
                    attract the largest percentage of tourists Germany has ever known. This cathedral is the true symbol
                    of
                    the city of Cologne, which leads many to consider the city of Cologne as a body without a soul
                    without
                    the cathedral «Dom». The cathedral belongs to the Catholic Church and is the seat of the Archbishop
                    of
                    Cologne. When its towers were completed in 1880, it was the tallest building in the world (its
                    towers
                    rise to 157 meters) and remained so until the construction of the Washington edifice in 1884.A
                    masterpiece of Gothic architecture, this UNESCO World Heritage site is Germany’s most visited
                    landmark,
                    boasting stunning stained-glass windows and towering spires. Construction began in 1248 but wasn’t
                    completed until 1880. Until 1884, the Cologne Cathedral was the tallest building in the world thanks
                    to
                    its towers which reach a height of over 500 feet.

                    The spectacular cathedral was built to house the Shrine of the Three Kings, which is said to contain
                    the
                    remains of the Three Wise Men from the Gospel of St. Matthew, who followed a star to Bethlehem to
                    present gifts to Jesus.

                    During WWII, the cathedral was hit by 70 firebombs and 14 highly explosive bombs. Thankfully, its
                    size
                    and construction saved it from being utterly destroyed, as it served as a reference point for pilots
                    flying over the city.</p>
