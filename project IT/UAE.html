            <p class="container_disc">The heritage of the United Arab Emirates reflects a rich history rooted in Bedouin, maritime,
                 and desert traditions. Emiratis have long been known for their skills in pearl diving, falconry, and camel racing.
                 Traditional arts like Al Ayala dance and Nabati poetry celebrate the spirit of the land. Before the discovery of oil,
                 the economy was based on fishing, trade, and date farming. Ancient forts and souks still stand as symbols of the country's past.
                 Emirati clothing, like the kandura and abaya, blends tradition with identity. Hospitality remains a core value, with coffee and dates
                 offered to guests. The UAE continues to preserve its heritage while embracing modernity.

                <h2 class="name">Burj Khalifa</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world, standing at 828 meters.
                     Located in Dubai, it was officially opened in 2010. The tower represents the UAE’s vision for innovation and progress.
                     It features luxury residences, offices, and the famous At the Top observation decks. Burj Khalifa is not only an architectural 
                     marvel but also a global symbol of modern engineering and ambition. Designed by architect Adrian Smith, Burj Khalifa was inspired by
                     the shape of a desert flower and Islamic architecture. The building uses advanced engineering to withstand high winds and extreme temperatures.
                     It attracts millions of tourists every year who come to enjoy the panoramic views from its observation decks. At night, the tower lights up with 
                     stunning LED shows and celebrations. Burj Khalifa is a proud landmark of Dubai and a symbol of what human ambition can achieve.

                <p class="monument_disc">Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque is one of the largest and most beautiful mosques in the world. Located in Abu Dhabi, 
                     it was completed in 2007 and named after Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the founding father of the UAE. The mosque features 82 white domes,
                     over 1,000 columns, and the world’s largest hand-knotted carpet. Its design blends traditional Islamic architecture with modern styles.
                     The mosque welcomes visitors from all religions and is a symbol of peace, tolerance, and cultural respect. At sunset,
                     the mosque glows beautifully under specially designed lighting that reflects the phases of the moon.

                <h2 class="name">Palm Island</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">Palm Jumeirah is one of the most famous man-made islands in the world, located in Dubai, UAE. Shaped like a palm tree,
                     it stretches into the Arabian Gulf and is visible from space. The island features luxury hotels, private villas, resorts, and entertainment attractions.
                     Construction began in 2001 and involved advanced engineering techniques to create its unique shape. Building Palm Jumeirah required millions of tons of
                     sand and rocks, without using concrete or steel for its foundation. The island’s protective crescent acts as a breakwater to shield it from strong sea waves.
                     Engineers used satellite technology and precise GPS systems during construction to maintain its perfect palm shape. Palm Jumeirah is a symbol of Dubai’s creativity
                     and ambition, attracting millions of tourists every year. It is home to iconic landmarks like Atlantis, The Palm, and offers beautiful beaches and world-class dining
                     experiences. Today, Palm Jumeirah stands as a global example of innovation and ambition in urban development, and it continues to grow with new residential projects, luxury hotels, and leisure destinations.
