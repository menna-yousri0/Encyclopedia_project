                <h2 class="name">Forbidden City</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">The Forbidden City is a massive palace complex located in the heart of Beijing, China.
                     It was the imperial residence of Chinese emperors for almost 500 years, from the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) to the end of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912).
                     Covering an area of around 180 acres, it consists of nearly 1,000 buildings, making it the largest palace complex in the world. The name "Forbidden City" reflects the strict rules that prevented common people from entering the palace without permission, and only the emperor, his family,
                     and selected officials had access. The architecture is an outstanding example of traditional Chinese design, featuring golden roofs, red walls, and intricate woodwork. Inside, the palace is divided into two main sections: the Outer Court for ceremonial purposes and the Inner Court where the emperor and his family lived.
                     The Forbidden City is home to numerous priceless artifacts and works of art, showcasing the wealth and power of the Chinese imperial family. Today, it is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most visited museums in the world, attracting millions of tourists every year.

                <h2 class="name">Terracotta army</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">The Terracotta Army is a collection of over 8,000 life-sized statues that were buried with China’s first emperor, Qin Shi Huang, in 210–209 BC, as part of his tomb complex. The statues were created to protect the emperor in the afterlife and to serve as a symbol of his power and military might.
                     The army is made up of soldiers, chariots, horses, and even some officials, all crafted from terracotta clay. Each figure is unique, with different facial expressions, hairstyles, clothing, and armor, reflecting the diversity and rank of the emperor’s real army. In addition to the soldiers,
                     there are also statues of archers, cavalrymen, and generals, arranged in precise battle formation, with real weapons such as bronze swords, spears, and crossbows. The discovery of the Terracotta Army in 1974 by local farmers digging a well near Xi’an, China, was one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century.
                     The statues were originally painted in bright colors, but most of the paint has faded over time. Despite this, the level of detail and craftsmanship is remarkable. Today, the Terracotta Army is housed in a vast museum at the site of its discovery and is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It attracts millions of visitors from all over the world, 
                     offering a fascinating glimpse into ancient Chinese culture, art, and military history.
