            <p class="container_disc">Indian heritage is one of the oldest and most diverse in the world, 
                with a history spanning thousands of years. It is a fusion of ancient traditions, diverse cultures,
                and rich religious practices, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. The Indus Valley Civilization, 
                which flourished around 2500 BC, is one of the earliest urban cultures in the world. Over the centuries, 
                India saw the rise and fall of powerful empires such as the Maurya, Gupta, Mughal, and Rajput dynasties, 
                each leaving its mark on Indian art, architecture, and literature. India's cultural practices, including classical music, dance, yoga,
                and cuisine, are renowned globally. The country’s vast array of festivals, like Diwali, Holi, and Eid, reflects its deep connection to spirituality and community.
                Today, Indian heritage continues to thrive, blending traditional elements with modern influences.

                <p class="monument_disc">The Taj Mahal is one of the most famous landmarks in the world and a symbol of eternal love. Located in Agra, India,
                     it was built by Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal, who passed away during childbirth in 1631.
                     The Taj Mahal is an exquisite example of Mughal architecture, combining elements of Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian styles.
                     Constructed from white marble, it features intricate carvings, beautiful gardens, and a large reflecting pool.
                     The monument is not only a testament to love but also a masterpiece of engineering and design. Today, 
                     the Taj Mahal is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and attracts millions of tourists every year.

                <h2 class="name">Palace Of The Winds</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">The Hawa Mahal, or "Palace of Winds," is an iconic structure located in Jaipur, India.
                     Built in 1799 by Maharaja Sawai Pratap Singh, the palace was designed to allow the royal women to observe the street festivals and everyday life without being seen,
                     as they were confined to the palace. The Hawa Mahal is famous for its unique architecture, featuring a five-story façade with 953 small windows, or "jharokhas,"
                     which are intricately designed to allow cool air to flow through the palace, keeping it cool in the hot desert climate of Rajasthan. The palace is built from pink sandstone,
                     giving it a distinctive color that complements the surrounding city. Although the palace doesn’t have many rooms inside, it remains a popular tourist 
                     destination due to its striking appearance and cultural significance. The Hawa Mahal stands as a symbol of the rich heritage and architectural brilliance of Rajasthan.

                <h2 class="name">Khajuraho Temples</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">The Khajuraho Group of Monuments is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Madhya Pradesh, India. Built between 950 and 1050 AD during the Chandela dynasty, 
                    the temples are renowned for their stunning architecture and intricate carvings. The temples are dedicated to Hindu and Jain deities, with the majority being Hindu. 
                    What makes the Khajuraho temples unique is their detailed sculptures, which depict not only religious themes but also scenes from daily life, erotic art, and celestial beings. 
                    The temples are divided into three main groups: Western, Eastern, and Southern, with the Western group being the most famous. The most iconic of these temples is the Kandariya Mahadev Temple, 
                    dedicated to Lord Shiva, known for its towering spire and exquisite relief sculptures. The Khajuraho temples are a testament to the artistic and architectural achievements of
                    medieval India and remain one of the most important cultural landmarks in the country.
