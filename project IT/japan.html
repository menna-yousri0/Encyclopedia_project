            <p class="container_disc">Japanese heritage is a rich blend of ancient traditions and modern influences. It has evolved over thousands of years, from the early Jomon period (14,000–300 BC) 
                through the highly refined culture of the Heian period (794–1185) to the influence of Buddhism, Zen, and samurai traditions. Traditional arts like tea ceremonies, 
                calligraphy, and ikebana (flower arranging) continue to thrive today. Japan’s cultural practices are also reflected in its architecture, with iconic structures like Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. 
                The country’s deep respect for nature is seen in its gardens and the celebration of seasonal festivals. Despite modernization, Japanese heritage remains a vital part of its national identity, 
                preserving a unique blend of old and new.

                     especially during the official climbing season in summer. The mountain is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its cultural significance and natural beauty. Surrounded by forests,
                     lakes, and hot springs, Mount Fuji is considered a spiritual symbol of Japan’s harmony between nature and human life.
