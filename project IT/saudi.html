            <p class="container_disc">Saudi heritage is deeply rooted in Bedouin traditions, Islamic history,
                 and the diverse cultures of the Arabian Peninsula. It reflects a lifestyle shaped by the desert environment, 
                 with customs like hospitality, storytelling, and poetry playing a central role. Traditional clothing,
                 such as the thobe and abaya, and crafts like weaving and pottery, are part of daily life and identity.
                 The Kingdom is home to important Islamic sites, including Mecca and Medina, which have influenced its religious
                 and cultural development for centuries. Saudi architecture, from mud-brick forts to elegant mosques,
                 showcases both practicality and artistry. The heritage also includes folk music, dances like the Ardah, and rich cuisine.
                 Today, Saudi Arabia celebrates and preserves its heritage while also promoting modernization and cultural exchange
                 through initiatives like Vision 2030.

                <h2 class="name">Madain Saleh(Al-Hijr)</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">Madain Saleh, also known as Al-Hijr, is a UNESCO World Heritage Site located in northwestern Saudi Arabia.
                     It was the second-largest city of the Nabataean Kingdom after Petra in Jordan. The site dates back to the 1st century AD and
                     features over 100 rock-cut tombs with intricate facades. These tombs were carved into sandstone mountains and reflect advanced
                     Nabataean engineering and art. Madain Saleh was an important stop on ancient trade routes, especially for incense and spices.
                     The site also includes wells, water channels, and remains of residential areas. It is considered the first World Heritage Site in Saudi Arabia.
                     Today, it stands as a symbol of the region’s deep historical and cultural roots.
                     Madain Saleh also holds great historical and religious significance, as it is mentioned in the Qur’an as the home of the ancient Thamud people.
                     The Nabataeans developed an advanced system of water management, including cisterns and reservoirs carved into rock.
                     Many of the tombs have inscriptions in Nabataean script, giving insight into their language and customs. The surrounding 
                     landscape of desert and rock formations adds to the site’s unique beauty. Today, Madain Saleh is part of Saudi Arabia’s efforts to promote
                     cultural tourism and share its ancient heritage with the world.

                <h2 class="name">Kaaba</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">The Kaaba is the holiest site in Islam, located in the center of the Grand Mosque (Al-Masjid al-Haram) in Mecca,
                     Saudi Arabia. It is a cube-shaped building believed to have been originally built by the Prophet Abraham (Ibrahim) and his son Ishmael (Ismail)
                     as a house of worship dedicated to the one true God. Muslims around the world face the Kaaba during their daily prayers, known as the Qibla.
                     The Kaaba is also the focal point of the Hajj pilgrimage, which every able Muslim is required to perform at least once in their lifetime.
                     It is covered with a black silk cloth known as the Kiswah, which is embroidered with Quranic verses in gold. The Kaaba symbolizes the 
                     unity of Muslims worldwide and their devotion to God.
                     The Kaaba is the most sacred structure in Islam and plays a central role in the spiritual life of Muslims. Located in the heart of Mecca,
                     it is surrounded by the Grand Mosque, the largest mosque in the world. The structure itself is simple, built from granite and standing about 15 meters high.
                     At its eastern corner is the Black Stone (al-Hajar al-Aswad), which pilgrims try to kiss or touch during
                     the Tawaf—the act of circling the Kaaba seven times during Hajj and Umrah.

                <h2 class="name">Mount Uhud</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">Mount Uhud is a famous mountain located to the north of Medina in Saudi Arabia.
                     It holds great historical and religious significance in Islam. The mountain was the site of the Battle of Uhud,
                     which took place in the year 625 CE between the Muslim forces led by Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the Quraysh of Mecca.
                     Although the Muslims initially had the upper hand, the battle turned against them due to a strategic mistake, resulting in many losses.
                     Mount Uhud is also the resting place of many martyrs, including the Prophet’s beloved uncle, Hamza ibn Abdul-Muttalib, who is honored as the "Lion of Islam." 
                     Today, the mountain is visited by Muslims who come to reflect on the lessons of the battle, the sacrifice of the martyrs, and the importance of obedience and unity.
                     The Prophet Muhammad once said, “Uhud is a mountain that loves us, and we love it.” This saying reflects the deep 
                     emotional and spiritual connection Muslims have with this sacred site.
