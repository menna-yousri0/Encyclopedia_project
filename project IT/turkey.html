            <p class="container_disc">Turkish heritage is a rich blend of diverse cultures influenced by Central Asian, Persian, Arab, and Byzantine traditions.
                 The roots of Turkish culture date back to the nomadic Turkic tribes of Central Asia. The Seljuk Empire brought Islamic art and architecture to Anatolia. 
                 Later, the Ottoman Empire, lasting over 600 years, became one of the most powerful empires in history. It left a deep impact on art, music, cuisine,
                 and architecture, with landmarks like the Blue Mosque and Topkapi Palace. Turkish folk dances, music, and crafts like carpet weaving still reflect 
                 ancient traditions. The country's strategic location between Europe and Asia has enriched its cultural diversity. Turkish baths (hammams) and coffee
                 culture are also key elements of its heritage. Today, modern Turkey preserves its traditions while embracing progress.

                <p class="monument_disc">Topkapi Palace is a historic royal residence in Istanbul, Turkey. It was built in the 15th century by Sultan Mehmed II after
                     the conquest of Constantinople. For about 400 years, it served as the main residence and administrative center of the Ottoman sultans.

                     Imperial Council chambers. The palace also contained the Imperial Treasury, where priceless jewels, weapons, and artifacts were kept.
                     The Harem, a private section of the palace, housed the sultan’s family and was guarded by eunuchs. The palace reflects the wealth, power,
                     and sophistication of the Ottoman Empire. Its courtyards are surrounded by beautifully decorated rooms with Ottoman tiles, calligraphy,
                     and artwork. Topkapi also served as a training center for palace officials and servants. Its rich history and preserved beauty make it a symbol of imperial grandeur.

                <p class="monument_disc">The underground cities of Cappadocia, in central Turkey, are one of the region’s most fascinating historical features.
                     These cities, such as Derinkuyu and Kaymakli, were carved into soft volcanic rock thousands of years ago. They were used by ancient civilizations 
                     for protection against invasions and harsh weather. Some of them go as deep as 60 meters and could house thousands of people. Inside, there are tunnels,
                     living quarters, kitchens, churches, and even ventilation systems. The cities were designed to be hidden, with stone doors that could be rolled shut from the inside.
                     Today, they are open to tourists and show the impressive engineering of ancient Anatolia.Cappadocia’s underground cities were connected by tunnels and could be sealed 
                     off during times of danger. They had storage rooms for food, wells for water, and even areas for animals. These cities were used by early Christians as hiding places
                      during Roman persecution. The soft volcanic rock made it easy to carve out entire living spaces underground. Despite being hidden, they were cleverly designed for survival
                     and ventilation. Today, they are a key part of Cappadocia’s cultural and historical tourism.
