            <p class="container_disc">Costa Rica is known not only for its natural beauty but also for its rich archaeological heritage.
                 The country is home to ancient sites left behind by pre-Columbian civilizations, most notably the mysterious stone spheres
                 of Diquís, which are perfectly round stones carved by indigenous peoples over a thousand years ago. These spheres, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site,
                 continue to puzzle historians and archaeologists.

                    <h2 class="name">Manuel Antonio National Park</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc"> Manuel Antonio National Park, located on Costa Rica’s Pacific coast, is one of the country’s
                     smallest parks in size but among its most popular due to its incredible biodiversity and stunning natural landscapes.
                     Established in 1972, the park was created to protect the area's coastal ecosystems and tropical rainforests, which were threatened by development.
                     The park features white-sand beaches, lush forests, and scenic hiking trails that lead to breathtaking ocean views. 
                     It’s home to a variety of wildlife, including white-faced capuchin monkeys, sloths, iguanas, and hundreds of bird species. Visitors can enjoy swimming,
                     snorkeling, wildlife watching, and hiking — all in a paradise-like setting that showcases Costa Rica’s commitment to conservation and natural heritage.   
                     With the arrival of Spanish colonizers, the local population experienced significant disruption. Disease, conflict, and cultural assimilation nearly erased the native communities,
                     though the name of the nearby town, Quepos, still honors them. Over time, the area became a target for tourism and real estate development, especially as its beautiful beaches and
                     lush forests gained attention.

                    <h2 class="name">Arenal Volcano</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc"> Arenal Volcano is one of Costa Rica’s most iconic natural landmarks.
                     Located in the northern region near the town of La Fortuna, it rises majestically to 1,670 meters with a classic 
                     cone shape. Although it was dormant for centuries, a powerful eruption in 1968 marked the beginning of an active period that lasted until 2010. 
                     Today, the volcano is considered dormant, but it remains a symbol of the country’s volcanic heritage.
                     Arenal is part of the Arenal Volcano National Park, a protected area rich in biodiversity. The surrounding region features tropical rainforests,
                     hot springs, lava fields, and a wide variety of flora and fauna—including monkeys, toucans, sloths, and orchids. Visitors can enjoy hiking trails,
                     birdwatching, and panoramic views of both the volcano and nearby Lake Arenal, making it one of Costa Rica’s top eco-tourism and heritage destinations.
                     In addition to its dramatic natural beauty, Arenal Volcano has played a significant role in shaping the culture and lifestyle of the surrounding communities.
                     The fertile volcanic soil has supported rich agriculture, while geothermal energy has been harnessed as a sustainable power source for the region.
                     The nearby town of La Fortuna serves as a gateway to the volcano and is known for its welcoming atmosphere, local crafts, and traditional Costa Rican cuisine.
                     Visitors often explore the area’s hot springs, formed naturally by geothermal activity, and learn about the volcano’s history through local museums and guided tours.

                    <h2 class="name">Monteverde Cloud Forests</h2> 
                <p class="monument_disc"> Although Monteverde Cloud Forests are most famous for their biodiversity and unique
                     cloud forest ecosystem, the area also holds archaeological value. Evidence suggests that indigenous peoples inhabited this 
                     region thousands of years ago. Archaeologists have uncovered stone tools, pottery fragments, and basic foundations that indicate the
                     presence of early farming and hunting communities
                     These artifacts, while not as monumental as pyramids or temples found elsewhere in Central America, provide important insight into the
                     lives of pre-Columbian tribes who lived in harmony with the forest. Their connection to the land can still be felt today in the cultural traditions of Costa Rica’s indigenous groups.
                     While the forest itself does not contain large archaeological ruins, nearby regions and museums, like the National Museum in San José, preserve and display 
                     items from this era. Together, they offer a glimpse into the deep human history woven into Monteverde’s natural landscape.
                     Monteverde may be known for its misty forests and rich wildlife, but the area also has a quiet archaeological past. Long before modern settlers arrived, indigenous
                     communities lived in the region for centuries. Traces of their presence—like stone tools and pottery pieces—have been found in the surrounding areas, showing that these people once hunted,
                     Today, visitors can learn more about this hidden past by exploring museums in other parts of Costa Rica or joining
                     local cultural tours that highlight the region’s native roots.
