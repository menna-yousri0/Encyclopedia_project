            <p class="container_disc"> Jamaica is home to a rich blend of archaeological and historical sites that reflect its indigenous Taíno roots,
                 colonial history, and African heritage. From ancient rock carvings and Taíno caves to the sunken pirate city of Port Royal and colonial-era great houses,
                 the island’s landmarks tell stories of its vibrant and complex past.

                <h2 class="name">Dunn's River Falls</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">  Dunn’s River Falls is one of Jamaica’s most famous natural landmarks, 
                    located near the town of Ocho Rios. This stunning 180-meter (600-foot) cascading
                     waterfall flows over smooth limestone rocks and empties directly into the Caribbean Sea. It is a rare example of a travertine waterfall that continuously regenerates itself through mineral deposits.
                    Visitors often climb the terraced steps of the falls, hand-in-hand with guides,
                     making it both a natural wonder and a fun adventure. Surrounded by lush tropical vegetation, Dunn’s River Falls combines breathtaking scenery with cultural
                      and ecological significance, making it a must-visit heritage site in Jamaica.

                <p class="monument_disc"> The Bob Marley Museum is located in Kingston, Jamaica, at the former residence of reggae legend Bob Marley.
                     This historic home, where Marley lived and recorded music until his death in 1981, was transformed into a museum in 1986 by his wife, Rita Marley.
                     The museum preserves his legacy through personal artifacts, gold and platinum records, original recordings, photographs, and his favorite guitar.
                     Visitors can tour Marley's bedroom, his recording studio, and even see the bullet holes from a 1976 assassination attempt. The house is a powerful symbol of Jamaica’s 
                     cultural heritage and musical influence, attracting fans from all over the world. It stands as a tribute to Bob Marley's global impact and his message of peace, unity, and freedom.
