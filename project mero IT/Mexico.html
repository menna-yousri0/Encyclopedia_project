                <p class="monument_disc"> 
                    Chichén Itzá is one of the most iconic archaeological sites in Mexico and a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Located in the Yucatán Peninsula, it was once a major city of the ancient Maya civilization.
                     The site is best known for El Castillo, also called the Temple of Kukulcán — a massive step pyramid that reflects the Maya’s advanced knowledge of astronomy and architecture. Other significant structures include the Great Ball Court,
                     the Temple of the Warriors, and the Sacred Cenote, a natural sinkhole used for ceremonial purposes. Chichén Itzá is not only a symbol of ancient innovation but also a powerful reminder of Mexico's rich cultural past.​
                     Chichén Itzá is not only a masterpiece of ancient architecture but also a place filled with mystery and meaning. The site reveals the scientific and astronomical brilliance of the Maya,
                     especially during the spring and autumn equinoxes when a shadow in the shape of a serpent appears to slither down the pyramid’s steps. This phenomenon reflects the Maya’s deep understanding of the cosmos.
                     Walking through the ruins, visitors feel the spiritual and historical weight of a once-powerful civilization that left behind a legacy still admired today. Chichén Itzá continues to attract millions of tourists,
                     historians, and explorers from around the world each year.

                    <h2 class="name">Teotihuacan </h2>
                <p class="monument_disc"> Teotihuacan is one of the most remarkable archaeological sites in Mexico and Latin America, located about 50 kilometers northeast of Mexico City.
                     Known as the "City of the Gods," Teotihuacan was one of the largest and most influential cities of the ancient Mesoamerican world, flourishing between 100 BCE and 550 CE.
                     At its peak, it is estimated to have housed over 100,000 people, making it one of the largest cities in the world at the time.
                     The city is famous for its massive pyramids, especially the Pyramid of the Sun, which is the largest structure in Teotihuacan and one of the largest pyramids in the world. Nearby stands the Pyramid of the Moon,    
                     Teotihuacan is also known for its Avenue of the Dead, a wide road stretching more than 2 kilometers that connects the major temples and plazas. The city's complex urban design, multi-family housing compounds, 
                     and rich murals reveal a highly organized and sophisticated society with a deep spiritual life.   
                     Despite not knowing exactly who founded Teotihuacan, its influence extended far beyond its borders, affecting civilizations such as the Maya. The city was mysteriously abandoned around the 7th century,   
                     Today, Teotihuacan is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most visited archaeological sites in Mexico. Tourists from around the globe come to climb the ancient pyramids, explore its sacred streets,
                     and connect with a civilization that left a powerful and lasting legacy on the cultural history of Mesoamerica.

                    <h2 class="name">Matropolitan Cathedral</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">  known as the Metropolitan Cathedral, is one of the most iconic and historic landmarks in Mexico City. Located in the heart of the capital,
                     on the northern side of the Zócalo (main square), it stands as a symbol of Spanish colonial architecture and the deep-rooted Catholic heritage of the country.
                     Construction of the cathedral began in 1573 and continued over a span of nearly 250 years, resulting in a stunning blend of architectural styles, including Renaissance, Baroque, and Neoclassical.
                     Its massive structure, twin bell towers, and richly decorated interiors reflect the wealth and influence of the Spanish Empire during the colonial period.
                     Built atop the ruins of the ancient Aztec temple precinct, the cathedral represents a dramatic transition in Mexican history—from indigenous religious traditions to Catholicism imposed by the Spanish.
                     This symbolic transformation is deeply embedded in the cultural and religious fabric of Mexico.
                     Inside, the cathedral features impressive altars, chapels, and religious art, with intricate gold detailing, statues of saints, and elaborate paintings that tell stories of faith and conquest.
                     One of the highlights is the Altar of the Kings (Altar de los Reyes), an extraordinary baroque masterpiece.
                     The Metropolitan Cathedral has withstood centuries of natural disasters, including earthquakes and subsidence due to Mexico City being built on a lakebed. Ongoing preservation efforts have helped maintain its grandeur,
                      allowing visitors to continue exploring its historical and spiritual significance.
