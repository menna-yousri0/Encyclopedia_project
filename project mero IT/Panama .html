            <p class="container_disc">Panama is a Central American country known for its strategic canal and vibrant cultural blend.
                 It’s also home to rich archaeological heritage, including ancient petroglyphs, pre-Columbian artifacts, and indigenous ruins like those found in the Coclé and Darién regions.

                    <h2 class="name">Panama Canal</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">The Panama Canal is not only one of the most impressive engineering feats of the modern world, but it is also surrounded by a region rich in archaeological
                     and historical significance. Long before the canal was built, the narrow isthmus that connects North and South America was home to thriving pre-Columbian civilizations. Archaeologists have
                     discovered ancient artifacts such as pottery, tools, burial urns, and gold ornaments in areas around the canal, pointing to the presence of indigenous cultures that lived and traded in the region for thousands of years.
                     These findings show that Panama was more than just a geographical bridge—it was a cultural crossroads. With the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th
                     century, Panama became a vital link in the Spanish colonial empire. The remains of forts like San Lorenzo and Portobelo, built to defend treasure routes from pirate attacks,
                     still stand today as powerful reminders of colonial conflict and ambition. The ruins of Panamá Viejo, the first European settlement on the Pacific coast of the Americas, also speak to centuries of European influence,
                     destruction, and rebuilding. When the canal was constructed in the early 1900s, and again during its expansion in the 21st century, further archaeological discoveries
                     were made—including colonial relics, early industrial tools, and artifacts from the laborers who built the canal.
                     Altogether, the Panama Canal region tells a multilayered 
                     story: one of ancient cultures, European conquest, global trade, and human innovation. It's a place where history is literally carved into the land.

                     These are the remains of the original Panama City, founded in 1519 and later destroyed by the infamous pirate Henry Morgan in 1671. Once a bustling hub of Spanish colonial trade, the site now offers visitors a glimpse into the early history of
                     the Americas, with preserved cathedral towers, convent walls, and ancient stone streets that echo the stories of explorers, merchants, and settlers.
                     Panamá Viejo Ruins
                     The ruins of Panamá Viejo are what remain of the first European settlement on the Pacific coast of the Americas. Once a vibrant
                     colonial city, it was a key point on Spain’s trade route between the New World and Europe. Today, visitors can walk among the ruins of churches, homes, and government buildings, 
                     experiencing the rich cultural and architectural legacy left behind after centuries of change and conflict.  
                     Panamá Viejo is one of the most important historical landmarks in Panama, offering a rare glimpse into the city’s origins.
                     Founded by the Spanish in the early 16th century, it was the first permanent European settlement on the Pacific coast of the Americas. The ruins,
                     now carefully preserved, include the remains of churches, government buildings, and residential homes that once formed a bustling colonial capital. Although much of the city was destroyed by fire

                    <h2 class="name">Ancon Hill</h2> 
                <p class="monument_disc">Cerro Ancón is a prominent hill located within Panama City that holds great historical, ecological, and symbolic value. Rising above the modern skyline, this lush green hill was once part of the Panama Canal
                     Zone and served as a strategic lookout point and residential area for U.S. military personnel during the American administration of the canal. At its peak, the U.S. established the Quarry Heights military base, which became the headquarters
                     of the U.S. Southern Command. Today, Cerro Ancón is a protected natural reserve, home to native wildlife such as sloths, toucans, and armadillos, making it a peaceful escape from the bustling city below. The hill is also a powerful national symbol
                     for Panamanians—atop it proudly waves the Panamanian flag, visible from much of the city, representing the country’s sovereignty and independence. Cerro Ancón also offers sweeping panoramic views of both the Pacific Ocean and the Panama Canal, making
                     it a popular spot for both locals and tourists. Walking trails lead visitors past remnants of historical buildings, scenic lookouts, and informative signs that highlight the area’s role in the political and cultural history of Panama. In short, Cerro
                     Ancón is more than just a hill—it’s a living monument to Panama’s past, present, and future.
