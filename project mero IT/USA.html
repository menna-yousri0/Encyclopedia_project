            <p class="container_disc">The heritage of the United States is a tapestry woven from diverse cultures,
                indigenous roots, and immigrant traditions. Native American customs, African American influences, and contributions from European,
                 Asian, and Latin American communities have shaped the nation’s identity. Folk music, jazz, and blues reflect deep cultural histories,
                  while national parks preserve the natural beauty that inspired early settlers. Historical landmarks, from colonial towns to Civil War battlefields,
                   tell stories of struggle and unity. American values like freedom, innovation, and diversity are expressed in its art, literature, and cuisine. Today,
                    the U.S. continues to honor its rich past while evolving as a global cultural leader.

                    <h2 class="name">ٍStatue of Liberty</h2>
                <p class="monument_disc">  The Statue of Liberty is one of the most iconic landmarks in the United States, located on Liberty Island in New York Harbor.
                     A gift from France in 1886, it was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel.
                     The statue represents freedom and democracy, symbolized by a woman holding a torch and a tablet inscribed with the date of American independence, July 4, 1776.
                     Standing at a total height of 305 feet, it welcomed millions of immigrants arriving by sea during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
                     The interior includes a museum that tells the story of its creation and significance. Designated as a National Monument in 1924,
                     the Statue of Liberty continues to inspire visitors from around the world. It stands as a powerful symbol of hope, liberty, and the enduring spirit of the American people.
                     The Statue of Liberty stands as a universal symbol of freedom and democracy.
                     Located at the entrance of New York Harbor,
                     this majestic statue has greeted travelers and immigrants since its unveiling in 1886.
                     Made of copper and standing atop a granite pedestal, the statue depicts a robed woman representing Libertas,
                     the Roman goddess of liberty. Her raised torch lights the path to freedom,
                     while her broken chains at her feet represent the end of oppression. Over time,
                     the Statue of Liberty has become more than a monument—it is a cultural icon of the United States,
                     featured in countless films, books, and artworks. As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it continues to attract millions of tourists every year who come to experience its powerful message and panoramic views of New York City.
